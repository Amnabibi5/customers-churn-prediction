# Customer Churn Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict telecom customer churn based on historical data.

## 📌 Objective
To build and evaluate a classification model that predicts if a customer will churn, enabling businesses to retain valuable customers.

## 📂 Files Included
- `Customer_Churn_Prediction_Full_Notebook.ipynb`: Full code in Colab format
- `Customer_Churn_Prediction_Presentation.pptx`: 10-slide project summary
- `app.py`: Optional app for model demo
- `requirements.txt`: Libraries used in the project

## 🔧 Tools & Tech
- Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Gradio (for optional deployment)
- Git & GitHub

## 📊 Results
The final model (Random Forest Classifier) achieved ~82% accuracy with strong precision and recall for identifying churners.

## 🏁 Future Work
- Balance dataset with SMOTE
- Tune hyperparameters
- Deploy with gradio or Flask
